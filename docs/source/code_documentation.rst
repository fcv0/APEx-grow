Code Documentation
========

The repository of all code can be found at https://github.com/fcv0/APEx-grow/tree/main and is split into two main sections. 

The "device_code" *LINK* 
folder contains all of the code for the arduino in the device as is documented within :ref:`firmware`.

The "user_code" *LINK*
contains all of the code to run on either a raspberry pi or PC which is connected to the arduino via a serial connection and handles user input, data display and data storage. 
This code is documented below in :ref:`GUI`. The communication between the arduino and computer is documented in :ref:`communication`.
