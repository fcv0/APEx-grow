Welcome to APEx Grow's documentation!
===================================
------------------

**APEx Grow** is a low-cost open-source bioreactor for use to maintain a biological culture in a well-mixed
environment at a desired temperature. The device comes with an inline sensor which will monitor
and record the temperature and optical density of the culture at high time resolution.

**APEx Grow** is designed to be easily manufactured with standard laboratory supplies and a 3D printer. At the core of the device it uses a custom inline OD and temperature sensor designed around a standard cuvette with added 3D printed components for easy manufacture.
Fluid from the culture is constantly circulated through this sensor by a peristaltic pump and the sensor can be setup to measure OD in up to 5 different wavelengths.
The main culture chamber itself has an inbuilt heat mat to control the temperature and a magnetic stir bar to ensure adequate mixing.
